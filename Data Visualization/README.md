This notebook describes my first experience with Data Preprocessing and Data Visualizations before applying any actual Machine Learning Algorithm.

Classification and Regression Dataset preprocessing and Visualisation.

This notebook also includes my review of Linear Algebra and Probability Theory from "Deep Learning" Book from "MIT Press".
