This notebook describes my own implementation of Linear Regression Models using Least Squares and Least Mean Squares Method.

A linear model can be defined as the approach of modeling the scaler response of a dependent variable with one or more independent or exploratary variables.

Dataset : **Bike Sharing Dataset** in Capital bikeshare system between years 2011 and 2012. In this dataset, I have various features and based on these features we use both of these models to predict the count of rented bikes and compare/visualize with the results that are already in our dataset.

It also includes few experiments on how to choose the best learning rate in Stochastic Gradient Descent Method and how to find the best parameters for your model.
